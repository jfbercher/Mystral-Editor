### Prerequisites

- **Node.js v20** — recommended version; required for the test suite.
- **Rust and Cargo** (stable toolchain) — required only to build the Tauri desktop application.
- **Tauri CLI** — install with `cargo install tauri-cli` or `npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli`.

### Repository Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jfbercher/Mystral-Editor.git
cd Mystral-Editor
npm install
```

Mystral Editor requires a few additional packages beyond the upstream baseline:

```bash
npm install katex markdown-it-texmath js-yaml @codemirror/lang-python
```

### Development

Start the Vite dev server with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run with native Tauri desktop features (file dialogs, filesystem access, updater):

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Building

Build the web app only:

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the full Tauri desktop application for the current platform:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Cross-platform release builds (macOS Apple Silicon/Intel, Linux x64/ARM64, Windows) are produced automatically by the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yaml`) when a `v*` tag is pushed.

### Running the Tests

The Playwright suite runs against the **built and previewed** app. Start three processes before running tests.

First-time setup:

```bash
npm install && npx playwright install
```

Terminal 1 — build and preview the app:

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

Terminal 2 — collaboration server:

```bash
cd bin && npm install
YPERSISTENCE=/tmp/myst-yjs-db PORT=4455 node server.js
```

Terminal 3 — run the tests (Node 20 required):

```bash
npx -y node@20 /usr/bin/npm run test
```

To run a single test, pass a `-g` name filter:

```bash
npx -y node@20 node_modules/@playwright/test/cli.js test -c tests/playwright.config.js -g "test name"
```

### Releasing a New Version

Use the `Makefile` release target to bump versions, commit, tag, and push:

```bash
make release VERSION=x.y.z
```

This updates the version string in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `tauri.conf.json`, creates a git tag `vx.y.z`, and pushes it — triggering the CI release workflow automatically.
